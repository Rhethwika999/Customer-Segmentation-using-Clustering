# Customer-Segmentation-using-Clustering 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

### Aim 🎯
To identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. This segmentation helps an online retailer understand customer value and tailor marketing strategies effectively.

### Objectives ✅

* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer transaction data.

* Create RFM features for each customer.

* Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.

* Standardize features for clustering.

* Apply K-Means clustering to group customers based on purchasing patterns.

* Identify optimal number of clusters using Elbow and Silhouette methods.

* Interpret the resulting customer segments for business insights.

### Dataset Details
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/code/akramhussainkhan/time-series-analysis-for-retail-data/input

Total Records: 541,909 rows × 8 columns

#### Columns:

InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country

#### Preprocessing Steps:

* Removed rows with null CustomerID or Description

* Added new features: Amount, Recency, Frequency, Monetary

* Treated outliers in RFM features

* Standardized data for clustering

### Libraries & Packages Used
numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, datetime, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.cluster, sklearn.metrics

### Inferences & Conclusion

Best Number of Clusters: 3 (based on silhouette score and elbow method).

#### Cluster Insights:

Cluster 1: High-value customers with high transaction amounts and frequency — ideal for loyalty programs.

Cluster 0: Moderately active customers — potential for targeted marketing.

Cluster 2: Least active and infrequent buyers — less business impact, can be targeted with re-engagement offers.

K-Means clustering effectively segmented customers, aiding personalized marketing and improving customer relationship strategies.
